# SAMPLE NON-DISCLOSURE AGREEMENT

This Non-Disclosure Agreement ("Agreement") is entered into as of March 1, 2025 (the "Effective Date"), by and between Acme Corporation, a Delaware corporation ("Disclosing Party"), and Beta Solutions LLC, a California limited liability company ("Receiving Party").

WHEREAS, the parties desire to enter into a business relationship; and

WHEREAS, in connection with such relationship, the Disclosing Party may disclose certain confidential and proprietary information to the Receiving Party;

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants and agreements set forth herein and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties agree as follows:

## 1. Definition of Confidential Information

"Confidential Information" means any and all information disclosed by the Disclosing Party to the Receiving Party, whether in oral, written, electronic, or other form, that is designated as confidential or that should reasonably be understood to be confidential given the nature of the information and the circumstances of disclosure, including but not limited to:

   (a) Technical information, including patents, patent applications, research, product plans, products, developments, inventions, processes, formulas, techniques, designs, drawings, engineering, hardware configuration information, and software;
   
   (b) Business information, including customer lists, supplier lists, pricing information, cost information, business plans, marketing plans, and financial information; and
   
   (c) Any other information marked as "Confidential," "Proprietary," or with a similar designation.

## 2. Obligations of Receiving Party

The Receiving Party shall:

   (a) Hold and maintain the Confidential Information in strict confidence using the same degree of care that it uses to protect its own confidential information, but in no event less than reasonable care;
   
   (b) Not disclose any Confidential Information to any third party without the prior written consent of the Disclosing Party, except to its employees, contractors, and advisors who have a legitimate need to know such information and who are bound by confidentiality obligations at least as protective as those contained herein;
   
   (c) Use the Confidential Information solely for the purpose of evaluating and engaging in a potential business relationship with the Disclosing Party; and
   
   (d) Not reverse engineer, disassemble, or decompile any prototypes, software, or other tangible objects that embody the Confidential Information.

## 3. Exclusions from Confidential Information

Confidential Information does not include information that:

   (a) Is or becomes publicly available through no breach of this Agreement by the Receiving Party;
   
   (b) Was rightfully in the Receiving Party's possession prior to disclosure by the Disclosing Party, as evidenced by written records;
   
   (c) Is rightfully received by the Receiving Party from a third party without breach of any confidentiality obligation; or
   
   (d) Is independently developed by the Receiving Party without use of or reference to the Confidential Information, as evidenced by written records.

## 4. Permitted Disclosures

The Receiving Party may disclose Confidential Information to the extent required by law or court order, provided that the Receiving Party gives the Disclosing Party prompt written notice of such requirement and cooperates with the Disclosing Party in any effort to seek a protective order or other appropriate relief.

## 5. Term and Termination

   (a) **Term**: The obligations of confidentiality shall continue for a period of five (5) years from the date of disclosure of each item of Confidential Information.
   
   (b) **Return of Materials**: Upon termination of this Agreement or upon request by the Disclosing Party, the Receiving Party shall promptly return or destroy all Confidential Information and provide written certification of such destruction.

## 6. No License or Warranty

Nothing in this Agreement grants the Receiving Party any rights, license, or interest in the Confidential Information, except as expressly set forth herein. All Confidential Information is provided "AS IS" without warranty of any kind.

## 7. Injunctive Relief

The Receiving Party acknowledges that the disclosure of Confidential Information would cause irreparable harm to the Disclosing Party for which monetary damages would be an inadequate remedy. Accordingly, the Disclosing Party shall be entitled to seek equitable relief, including injunction and specific performance, in the event of any breach or threatened breach of this Agreement.

## 8. Governing Law and Dispute Resolution

   (a) **Governing Law**: This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, without regard to its conflict of law principles.
   
   (b) **Dispute Resolution**: Any dispute arising out of this Agreement shall first be subject to good faith negotiation between the parties for a period of thirty (30) days. If the dispute is not resolved through negotiation, it shall be submitted to binding arbitration under the rules of the American Arbitration Association.
   
   (c) **Attorney's Fees**: In any action to enforce this Agreement, the prevailing party shall be entitled to recover its reasonable attorney's fees and costs.

## 9. Entire Agreement

This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersedes all prior negotiations, representations, or agreements, whether written or oral, relating to such subject matter.

## 10. Amendments

This Agreement may not be amended except by a written instrument signed by both parties.

## 11. Severability

If any provision of this Agreement is held to be invalid or unenforceable, the remaining provisions shall continue in full force and effect.

## 12. Waiver

No waiver of any provision of this Agreement shall be effective unless in writing and signed by the party against whom the waiver is sought to be enforced. No failure to exercise any right or delay in exercising any right shall constitute a waiver thereof.

## 13. Assignment

Neither party may assign this Agreement without the prior written consent of the other party, except that either party may assign this Agreement to a successor in interest in connection with a merger or sale of all or substantially all of its assets.

## 14. Notices

## 15. Counterparts and Electronic Signatures
